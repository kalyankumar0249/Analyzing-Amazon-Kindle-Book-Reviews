# Analyzing-Amazon-Kindle-Book-Reviews

Leveraging unstructured data has gained a lot of attention these days due to its significant importance 
in giving a competitive advantage to the companies. Imagine how much time consuming it is for a 
company to manually go through millions of user reviews to understand what user likes or dislikes 
about a service. Our main goal is to effectively use text analytics to understand the user reviews on 
books and automate the sentiment classification of a review.

The main intent of this project is to use Pyspark (specifically SQL data frames) and Google cluster for 
performing topic modeling of large-scale data and building machine learning models for sentiment 
classification. In this process, we will also explore NLP libraries available in Spark.
